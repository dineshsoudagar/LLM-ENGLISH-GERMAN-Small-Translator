# Qwen QA - Local LLM Android App

This Android application integrates a local ONNX-converted LLM for interactive, on-device question answering. It uses a Hugging Face-compatible tokenizer and supports streaming inference for efficient generation.

## Features

- On-device question answering using ONNX Runtime.
- Hugging Face-style BPE tokenizer (`tokenizer.json` compatible).
- Qwen-compatible prompt formatting with streaming generation.
- Coroutine-based inference pipeline.
- Runs offline, preserving privacy.

## Example Prompts

Use these prompts to test the app or create screenshots:

- **General Knowledge:**  
  *"Who was the first president of the United States?"*

- **Science:**  
  *"Explain the theory of relativity in simple terms."*

- **Math:**  
  *"What is the integral of x^2?"*

- **Programming Help:**  
  *"What is the difference between a list and a tuple in Python?"*

- **Language:**  
  *"Translate 'Hello, how are you?' into French."*

## Model

This app uses the **Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct** model for local QA tasks.

### Preconverted ONNX Model

Download the ONNX version here:

- [onnx-community/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/onnx-community/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct)

Place `model.onnx` inside your projectâ€™s `assets/` directory.

### Download Tokenizer

Also download `tokenizer.json` from:

- [Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct)

Put `tokenizer.json` in the same `assets/` directory.

### OR: Convert the Model Yourself

```
pip install optimum[onnxruntime]
```
or
```
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum.git
```
then export with, 
```
optimum-cli export onnx --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct qwen2.5-0.5B-onnx/
```
